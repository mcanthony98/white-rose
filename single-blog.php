                <p>Achieving streak-free windows is the holy grail of cleaning tasks. Whether youâ€™re prepping for a big event, ensuring your storefront looks its best, or simply doing your weekly clean-up, streak-free windows can make a significant difference in how bright and inviting a space feels.</p>

                <p>Windows are often the first thing people notice when they walk into a room, and nothing beats the look of crystal-clear glass. Here are some tried-and-true methods to ensure your windows are not just clean but gleaming.</p>

            <div class="w-lg-65 mx-lg-auto">
                <h3>1. Choose the Right Tools</h3>
                <p>Start with the basics: a high-quality squeegee, a bucket of warm soapy water, and a microfiber cloth. The squeegee will remove most of the water, while the microfiber cloth will ensure no streaks are left behind.</p>

                <h3>2. Avoid Cleaning on Sunny Days</h3>
                <p>It might seem counterintuitive, but cleaning windows on a sunny day can actually cause streaks. The sun dries the cleaning solution too quickly, leaving streaks behind. Instead, clean your windows on a cloudy day or in the evening.</p>

                <h3>3. Use a Homemade Cleaning Solution</h3>
                <p>A simple mixture of water, white vinegar, and a few drops of dish soap can be just as effective as store-bought cleaners. Vinegar cuts through grime and leaves your windows sparkling.</p>

                <h3>4. Dry Thoroughly</h3>
                <p>After squeegeeing, use a dry microfiber cloth to wipe around the edges of the window where excess water can gather. This will prevent water spots and ensure a streak-free finish.</p>

                <h3>5. Consider a Professional Service</h3>
                <p>If you want guaranteed results, consider hiring a professional window cleaning service. At White Rose Cleaners, we offer specialized window cleaning that ensures your windows are spotless and streak-free, saving you time and effort.</p>
